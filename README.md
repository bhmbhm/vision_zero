# Vision Zero: Predicting Crash Fatalities in Houston

This repository contains code produced during the 2019 Houston Hackathon and for the subsequent meeting with the Mayor of Houston. All working code is contained in the `code` directory and is numbered by order in which it must be run in the pipeline. The R scripts `code/04_match_transit_to_intersections.R` and `code/04b_match_sidewalks_to_intersections.R` use data that is not publicly, so they will not be able to be reproduced if you clone this repository. However, the outputs from these scripts are stored in the `data` directory and the rest of the pipeline can be run as necessary.
